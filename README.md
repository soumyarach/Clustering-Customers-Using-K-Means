# Clustering-Customers-Using-K-Means

# What I Built?
I built a customer segmentation model using K-Means clustering, which groups customers based on their age, annual income, and spending score. This model helps businesses understand different customer segments and tailor their marketing strategies.

# Why I Built It?
- Customer Insights: To identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior.
- Targeted Marketing: To enable businesses to create personalized marketing campaigns for each segment.
- Data-Driven Decisions: To provide a data-driven approach to customer segmentation.

# How I Built It?
1. Data Preparation: Loaded a sample dataset with customer information.
2. Feature Normalization: Used StandardScaler to normalize features for clustering.
3. Optimal K Selection: Applied the elbow method to determine the best number of clusters.
4. K-Means Clustering: Implemented K-Means clustering with the optimal number of clusters.
5. Visualization: Visualized clusters using scatter plots and pair plots to understand segment characteristics.
